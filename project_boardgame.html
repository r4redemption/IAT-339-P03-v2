            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              This board game project was a great opportunity or me to apply my love of games and game knowledge which heavily influenced my upbringing.
              We were to design a board game with at least three of the four economic activities of accumulating, crafting, conversion and trade.
              The board game also needed balancing between chance and strategy, game objects, transitive and/or intransitive mechanics, bartering, currency,
              production mechanisms, positive and negative feedback loops, and deadlock prevention.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up playing Age of Empires II, Red Alert 2 and watching my Uncles play Heroes of Might and Magic III,
              I had a solid foundation in game knowledge and economy and a fascination with medieval theme.
              My passion for gaming lead me to easily brainstorm up many ideas, almost all of which were implemented into the game.
              The game board had tiles for resources, event cards (inspired from monopoly), and a boss lair.
              This was done to give players with different playstyles a variety of ways to win  the game, inspired by Civilization 5.

          </div>
          <div class="project_slide">
            <p>
              In order to cater to all types of players, we incorporated bosses to kill, cities to build, characters to roleplay as,
              resources to manage, daily events, and event tiles. Our attempt to indulge all player bases resulted in a game that was too wide in scope.
              In order to design and complete each game mechanic and aesthetic,
              we quickly ran out of time and had to sacrifice the time allotted for testing, as well as missing the deadline,
              resulting in a late and mildly unbalanced game. Though overdue, our project easily fulfilled game mechanic, aesthetic, and fidelity requirements.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              If given the chance to do this project again, I would tell myself not to let my passion overrun the scope of the project,
              narrow the game down by reducing some event mechanics and building cards.
              I would focus on the necessities and scale down the project to a more manageable size,
              trimming complexity in the game for a more positive user experience.

            <p>
              The goal of the game was to compete for the most victory points which can be earned by converting earned resources
              into building cards in the players starting city (corner), as well as killing the dragon in the lair which
              respawns regularly with increased difficulty and loot + resources
