            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              This final project of our interactive art course was to integrate
              artistic and interactive strategies into one final art piece.
              Initially inspired by the “Humans of New York” blog, An idea of photographing students around campus and gathering their background stories was born.
              However, upon review from our professor, it was clear that this project lacked depth and interaction.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
              Around that period of time, I was interested in “random acts of kindness”.
              I would walk past homeless people on the short distance from the train station to my campus regularly,
              and would often ponder about how the homeless would end up in their situation where society pass them by without a glance on the daily.
              I gave the suggestion that we should gather the life stories of the homeless instead, and our project took off once more with a new direction.
            </p>

          <div class="project_slide">
            <p>
              The new design goal was to rehumanize the unhoused individuals that we overlook regularly in an interactive and innovative way.
              When we interviewed the homeless around Granville-Burrard area, it gave these people a new dimension once we learned their history, dreams, struggles, and fears.
            </p>

          <div class="project_slide">
            <p>
              The interactive element we incorporated into the project was augmented reality.
              We used DAQRI 4D software to put the each interview onto a poster. The poster itself was a grim back alley,
              and only when a user hover over the poster with the DAQRI app, would each interviewee appear on the screen,
              which the users can then click on to learn more about. It accurately reflected the ignored nature of these individuals,
              yet would literally give a new dimension to the interviewed.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              We are very pleased with the project.
              We’ve had more fun than we expected making a real human connection with these people.
              If given more time, we would have liked to include the audio / video recordings onto the poster as well,
              which we wanted to but unfortunately couldn’t due to a deadline restraint.
