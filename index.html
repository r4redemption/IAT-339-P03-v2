          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            This final project of our interactive art course was to integrate
            artistic and interactive strategies into one final art piece.
            Initially inspired by the “Humans of New York” blog, An idea of photographing students around campus and gathering their background stories was born.
            However, upon review from our professor, it was clear that this project lacked depth and interaction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_slide slide" id="slide3">
          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            Around that period of time, I was interested in “random acts of kindness”.
            I would walk past homeless people on the short distance from the train station to my campus regularly,
            and would often ponder about how the homeless would end up in their situation where society pass them by without a glance on the daily.
            I gave the suggestion that we should gather the life stories of the homeless instead, and our project took off once more with a new direction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_slide slide" id="slide4">
          <p>
            The new design goal was to rehumanize the unhoused individuals that we overlook regularly in an interactive and innovative way.
            When we interviewed the homeless around Granville-Burrard area, it gave these people a new dimension once we learned their history, dreams, struggles, and fears.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_slide slide" id="slide5">
          <p>
            The interactive element we incorporated into the project was augmented reality.
            We used DAQRI 4D software to put the each interview onto a poster. The poster itself was a grim back alley,
            and only when a user hover over the poster with the DAQRI app, would each interviewee appear on the screen,
            which the users can then click on to learn more about. It accurately reflected the ignored nature of these individuals,
            yet would literally give a new dimension to the interviewed.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            We are very pleased with the project.
            We’ve had more fun than we expected making a real human connection with these people.
            If given more time, we would have liked to include the audio / video recordings onto the poster as well,
            which we wanted to but unfortunately couldn’t due to a deadline restraint.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              This board game project was a great opportunity or me to apply my love of games and game knowledge which heavily influenced my upbringing.
              We were to design a board game with at least three of the four economic activities of accumulating, crafting, conversion and trade.
              The board game also needed balancing between chance and strategy, game objects, transitive and/or intransitive mechanics, bartering, currency,
              production mechanisms, positive and negative feedback loops, and deadlock prevention.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up playing Age of Empires II, Red Alert 2 and watching my Uncles play Heroes of Might and Magic III,
              I had a solid foundation in game knowledge and economy and a fascination with medieval theme.
              My passion for gaming lead me to easily brainstorm up many ideas, almost all of which were implemented into the game.
              The game board had tiles for resources, event cards (inspired from monopoly), and a boss lair.
              This was done to give players with different playstyles a variety of ways to win  the game, inspired by Civilization 5.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <p>
              In order to cater to all types of players, we incorporated bosses to kill, cities to build, characters to roleplay as,
              resources to manage, daily events, and event tiles. Our attempt to indulge all player bases resulted in a game that was too wide in scope.
              In order to design and complete each game mechanic and aesthetic,
              we quickly ran out of time and had to sacrifice the time allotted for testing, as well as missing the deadline,
              resulting in a late and mildly unbalanced game. Though overdue, our project easily fulfilled game mechanic, aesthetic, and fidelity requirements.
            </p>

          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              If given the chance to do this project again, I would tell myself not to let my passion overrun the scope of the project,
              narrow the game down by reducing some event mechanics and building cards.
              I would focus on the necessities and scale down the project to a more manageable size,
              trimming complexity in the game for a more positive user experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <p>
              The goal of the game was to compete for the most victory points which can be earned by converting earned resources
              into building cards in the players starting city (corner), as well as killing the dragon in the lair which
              respawns regularly with increased difficulty and loot + resources
