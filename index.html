          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            This final project of our interactive art course was to integrate
            artistic and interactive strategies into one final art piece.
            Initially inspired by the “Humans of New York” blog, An idea of photographing students around campus and gathering their background stories was born.

          <div class="project_desc">
          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            Our art piece was lacking in meaning as well as interaction. Walking past homeless individuals often,
            I suggest that we can interview them instead.
            I suggested homeless individuals because they’re so often neglected and not all of them
            ended up in that situation at their own action; I was curious about their life stories.
          </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="project_slide slide">
          <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
          <div class="project_desc">
          <p>
            The new design goal was to interview homeless individuals with deep questions that
            we all ponder as human beings in an interactive and innovative way.
            This interview would give the unhoused individuals a new dimension we so seldom see.
            Thus rehumanizing them through communication. With a new meaningful design goal in mind,
            we needed to implement an interactive element to our project.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="project_slide slide">
          <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
          <div class="project_desc">
          <p>
            After group discussions, we agreed upon using augmented reality.
            We used DAQRI 4D software to put the each interview onto a poster. The poster itself was a grim back alley,
            and only when a user hover over the poster with the DAQRI app, would each interviewee appear on the screen,
            which the users can then click on to learn more about. It accurately reflected the ignored nature of these individuals,
            yet would literally give a new dimension to the interviewed.

          <div class="project_desc">
          <p>
            The group and I split into 2 groups to interview the homeless around Granville and Burrard skytrain stations.
            We asked questions about their dreams, fears, most treasured memories, favourite songs, plans for the future,
            and many other questions to round out their character in multi dimensional aspects.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              We are very pleased with the project.
              We’ve had more fun than we expected making a real human connection with these people.
              <!-- It adequately reflects the status of the homeless not in a financial, but a personal manner. -->
              Our project reflected the status of the homeless in a personal matter and the interactive element added to the meaning of the project.
              <!-- The project was meaningful and the interactive element added to the meaning of the project as well. -->
              However if given more time, we would have liked to include the audio / video recordings onto the poster as well,
              which we wanted to but unfortunately couldn’t due to a deadline restraint.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
            Our final assignment was to construct and demonstrate a polished physical board game which uses a complex economic system.
            My team and I chose a medieval and magical setting for the board game,
            and we started brainstorming off the many games and game mechanics that we’ve experienced in our lives.
            </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
            <div class="project_desc">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
            We were given a very basic board game and was given the goal to redesign our game around it.
            Starting off with a variety of resources,
            we need to turn those resources into ways the players could win the game.
            </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
            <div class="project_desc">
            <p>
              We took notice of multiple victory paths in Civilization and Settlers of Catan and took a similar approach:
              Players can earn victory points by building their city, or slaying the dragon.
              To achieve that, the players would need to choose to convert their resources into buildings for their city.
            </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
            <div class="project_desc">
            <p>
              My team and I easily came up with a wide array of ideas to implement into the game such as item crafting,
              resource trading, hero abilities, random event tiles, daily events, etc.
              That way players can choose their path by exploring events, managing resources, crafting items to upgrade their hero.

            </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
            <div class="project_desc">
            <p>
              When we conducted gameplay tests on our prototype, we realized that the game lasted too long.
              We lowered the victory point requirement, and introduced a new gold resource which could replace any other resource,
              or be used as currency. This added more flow in terms of game economy.
            </p>
            </div>

          <div class="project_slide slide">

            <div class="project_desc">
            <h2>Reflection </h2>
            <p>
              Our final board game was revised with much higher fidelity.
              Since we were so excited to create our own game and tried to cater to all levels and types of players,
              we quickly ran out of time in our schedule and had to cut down on play testing just to finish the project.
            </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="project_slide slide">
            <div class="project_img" id="sc1"></div>
            <div class="project_desc">
            <p>
              If I was given the chance to do this project again,
              I would focus down on a few game mechanics instead of making such a broad game that had everything.
              We easily satisfied the economy and complexity standards but lost marks for lateness since we needed an extra day to finish.
